 * This is an example "dynamic" block template that is rendered on the front end.
 * If you include an `index.php` file in a block folder, it will be
 * automatically included in the block registration as the `render_callback`.
 * If you use this approach, it is recommended that you recreate the markup with
 * JSX in the `index.js` file's `edit` function for the editor.
 *
 * Available globals:
 * - $attributes Block attributes
 * - $content    InnerBlock content (from `save()` in index.js)
 * - $metadata   Block registration metadata from block.json
