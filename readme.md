## Setup
How to begin working on your new theme, using the [Blackbird WP Theme Scaffold](https://github.com/BlackbirdDigital/wp-theme-scaffold) as a base.

Requirements: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

1. Create a **local copy** this theme ([zip](https://github.com/BlackbirdDigital/wp-theme-scaffold/archive/refs/heads/rough-pass.zip) or [clone](https://github.com/BlackbirdDigital/wp-theme-scaffold)). *Note: If cloning, remember to delete the `.git` directory.*
2. `cd` into the theme folder and run **`npm install`**.
3. Run **`npm start`** (runs `gulp`).
4. Create your [new repository](https://bitbucket.org/repo/create?workspace=blackbirddev). *Note: Do not include a README at this point.*
5. FIXME - Clone new repo, move files into repo, search & replaces (list out) initial commit & push
6. FIXME - might reorder to reduce steps

## Usage
When making edits to your theme, begin your work by running `gulp` in the theme directory. When finished, you can run `ctrl + C` (Mac) or close your teminal window to terminate the task.

# Structure
FIXME - basic description of structure, philosophy, anything its modeled after
